# Welcome, traveller!

I'm Daniel Dafoe, an inclusive web designer and software engineer from Earth. I've worked as a quality assurance tester, front-end developer, technical lead, design technologist, and an instructor. Creating web experiences everyone can use is _dearly_ important to me.

- 👯‍♀️ I'm interested in collaborating on open source projects needing CSS or accessibility expertise.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've sold nearly 500 items on Redbubble.
- 🙌 Pronouns: He/him
