# Hello and welcome!

I'm Daniel Dafoe, an inclusive web designer and developer from Earth. I've worked as a quality assurance tester, front-end developer, and a designer. Creating web experiences everyone can use is dearly important to me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a React + Next.js application very similar to https://lawsofux.com, but for software design patterns.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying English, Linguistics, and Philosophy part-time at the University of Toronto.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning American Sign Language.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've sold nearly 500 items on Redbubble.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
